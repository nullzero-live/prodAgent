# prodAgent
prodAgent is an experiment with modular, AI-driven market research tool designed to provide startups with valuable insights and intelligence. By leveraging large language models, prodAgent simulates a conversation between a market research expert and a Startup Founder. Still very much a work in progress.

The project has been through four iterations as I've become more comfortable with LangChain and the logic underlying both the Prompting and the information flow.
